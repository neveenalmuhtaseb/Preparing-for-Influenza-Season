# Preparing-for-Influenza-Season

## Project Overview
● Motivation: The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual
suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious
complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to
adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staﬃng agency provides this temporary
staff.

● Objective: Determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state.

● Scope: The agency covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States, and
the project will plan for the upcoming influenza season.

## Data set
all the data are from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC website.
